@ This example uses the stack to overwrite a string in memory with its
@  reverse. There are far batter ways to do this without a stack so this
@  example should only be taken as an illustration of the use of a stack.
@ 
@ The strrev subroutine pushes each character from a string on to the
@  system stack from start to end. It then returns to the start address
@  of the original string and, popping the characters back of the stack,
@  overwrites the original string with its reverse, taking advantage of the
@  Last-In-First-Out behaviour of stacks.
@
@ Add a "Watch" expression "(char*)&testStr1" or "(char[100]testStr1" to
@  view the strings as they are reversed.
@

Main:

  @ Assume we have two strings that need to be reversed. The strings
  @   start in memory at the addresses in R4 and R5.
