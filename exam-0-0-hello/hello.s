Main:

@
@ If you can read this and can build this program
@ using Visual Studio Code, then you have successfully
@ pulled the latest version of the GitLab Repository.
@
@ You will need to pull the latest version of the repository
@ again before or during the examination and you will be able
@ to do this 30 minutes before the start of the examination.
@

@
@ Let's test with a simple string copy ...

  @ Debugging tips:
  @
  @ If using the View Memory window
  @   - view stringA string using address "&stringA" and size 32
  @   - view stringB using address "&stringB" and size 32
  @
  @ If using a Watch Expression (array with ASCII character codes)
  @   view stringA using expression "(char[32])stringA"
  @   view stringB using expression "(char[32])stringB"
  @
  @ If using a Watch Expression (just see the string)
  @   view stringA using expression "(char*)&stringA"
  @   view stringB using expression "(char*)&stringB"
  @
